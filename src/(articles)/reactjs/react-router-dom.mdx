[React router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) is a popular library for handling routing in React applications.
What is routing? Routing is the process of determining what content to display based on the URL. 
For example, if the URL is `/about`, the router should display the About page.

To continue the blog you need to setup a react project and react-router-dom, you can checkout [Here](/blog/setup/react) and notice how the URL after the domain changes and you should have some knowledge of React, you can learn it [Here](/blog/react/learn-reactJs).

I shifted to NextJs and started to using NextJs router, this blog will also help me whenever I work on a React project.

# Setup

```jsx
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path: "/",
        element: <Home /> // Any react component
    },
    {
        path: "/test",
        element: <div>This is a test route</div>
    }
]);

export default function App() {
    return (
        <RouterProvider router={router} />
    );
}
```

# Navigating between routes

Now once you have setup the router, you can navigate between routes using the `Link` component.
Why not use the anchor tag? The anchor tag will reload the page and if you use router it will not reload the page and will be faster.

```jsx
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Home</h1>
            <Link to="/test">Test</Link>
        </div>
    );
}
```

And thats it, you have learned how to setup and navigate between routes using react-router-dom.


# URL parameters

Parameters are very powerful in routing, they can convey some data through routes. Say you want to display a user profile, you can use the user id as a parameter in the URL.

```jsx title="Setting up routes with parameters" ":id"
{
    path: "/user/:id",
    element: <UserProfile />
}
```

Now how can you access the parameter in the component?

```jsx title="Accessing parameters" "id" 
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

export default function UserProfile() {
    const { id } = useParams();
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>User Profile</h1>
            <p>User id: {id}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

# Query Parameters

Query parameters are key-value pairs added to the end of a URL after a ? symbol. They are commonly used to filter, sort, or pass additional data to a route without changing the URL structure. They can be used using `useSearchParams` hook.

```jsx {11-13,4}
import { useSearchParams } from "react-router-dom";

export default function App() {
  let [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();

    return (
        <div>
        <h1>Search</h1>
        <input
            type="text"
            defaultValue={searchParams.get("query") || ""}  // Get the query parameter
            onChange={(event) => {
            setSearchParams({ query: event.target.value }); // Update the query Parameter
            }}
        />
        </div>
    );
}

```

# Programmatic Navigation

You can also navigate between routes programmatically using the `useNavigate` hook.

```jsx "navigate" "useNavigate"
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

export default function Home() {
    const navigate = useNavigate();

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Home</h1>
            <button onClick={() => navigate("/test")}>Go to test</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

# Handling 404 pages

You can also handle 404 pages by adding a route with a `*` path in the router.

```jsx title="Handling 404 pages"
{
    path: "*",
    element: <NotFound />
}
```
