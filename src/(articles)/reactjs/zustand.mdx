Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management library for React. It provides a simple API for managing both global and local state without the complexity of other state management tools.

How will you send data from child to parent component or how will you share data with sibling component, all that complexity is solved by Zustand.

I personally prefer Zustand over Redux because it is much simpler to use and has a smaller bundle size. It is also easier to understand and debug.

` To install and configure Zustand with ReactJs head over to` [here](/blog/setup/react) 

# Setup

```jsx
import {create} from "zustand";

const useStore = create((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
    decrement: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
    reset: () => set({ count: 0 })
}));

export default useStore;
```

In Typescript

```tsx
import {create} from "zustand";

interface State {
    count: number;
    increment: () => void;
    decrement: () => void;
    reset: () => void;
}

const useStore = create<State>((set) => ({
    count: 0,
    increment: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
    decrement: () => set((state) => ({ count: state.count - 1 })),
    reset: () => set({ count: 0 })
}));

export default useStore;
```

The functions inside the store can also be asynchronous. You can use it to fetch data from an API or perform any other asynchronous operation.

# Retrieving state and updating state

Be careful while importing the store. If you import all the functions and state in a single import, it will cause the component to re-render whenever the state changes. Instead, import only the required functions and state.

```jsx
import useStore from "./store";

export default function Counter() {
    const count = useStore((state) => state.count);
    const increment = useStore((state) => state.increment);
    const decrement = useStore((state) => state.decrement);
    const reset = useStore((state) => state.reset);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{count}</h1>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
            <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
            <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Zustand also provides a method to use and updates states outside of a React Component.

```jsx
import useStore from "./store";

const func = () => {
    const increment = useStore.getState().increment;
    increment();
}
```

# Immer Middleware

Immer Middleware can be used to update the state in a more readable way and updating nested objects becomes easier.

### Installation

```bash
npm install immer
```

### Updating without Immer

```jsx {8-9}
import { create } from 'zustand'

const useStore = create((set) => ({
    marks: {
        maths: 90,
        science: 80
    },
    updateMathsMarks: (newMarks) => set((state) => ({ marks: { ...state.marks, maths: newMarks }})),
    updateScienceMarks: (newMarks) => set((state) => ({ marks: { ...state.marks, science: newMarks }}))
}))
```

See updating the nested object is a bit complex and can be hard to understand. But with Immer middleware you only need to update the required key and Immer will take care of the rest.

```jsx {9-10} caption="Just wrap the set function with Immer" /immer/3
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { immer } from 'zustand/middleware/immer'

const useStore = create(immer((set) => ({
    marks: {
        maths: 90,
        science: 80
    },
    updateMathsMarks: (newMarks) => set((state) => { state.marks.maths = newMarks }),
    updateScienceMarks: (newMarks) => set((state) => { state.marks.science = newMarks })
})))
```

# Persistent States

Zustand also provides a way to persist the state even after the page is refreshed. You can use the `persist` middleware to achieve this. The data is stored in Local Storage/Session Storage/IndexedDB.

It becomes very convenient to store the user's theme preference, language preference, or any other data that you want to persist.

```jsx caption="Just wrap the set function into persist" /persist/2 {9-11}
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useStore = create(persist(
    (set) => ({
        theme: 'light',
        setTheme: (theme) => set({ theme })
    }),
    {
        name: 'theme-storage'
    }
))
```

persist also takes a second argument which is an object with the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the storage key.
- `getStorage`: A function that returns the storage object. By default, it uses `localStorage`. You can also use `sessionStorage` or `indexedDB`.

Like this:
```jsx {11} title="Using sessionStorage" caption="sessionStorage is part of the window object just like localStorage and can be used in the same way."
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

const useStore = create(persist(
    (set) => ({
        theme: 'light',
        setTheme: (theme) => set({ theme })
    }),
    {
        name: 'theme-storage',
        getStorage: () => sessionStorage
    }
))
```



Here ends the basic use of Zustand to manage states. Thank you for reading, Shukriya 💐
