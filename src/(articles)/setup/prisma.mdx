Prisma is a wonderful ORM and it is very easy to setup. You can use Prisma with any database. Prisma is a type-safe database client. It helps you to write queries in your language and it converts it to SQL queries.

# Basic Project Setup 

If you look at my previous article on [Setting up Express](/blog/setup/express), I'm using a specific folder structure. I'll be using the same folder structure here. 

```md
*
|--- src
|    |--- db
|    |    |--- schema.prisma
|    |--- app.ts
```

You can checkout my previous article [Setting up Express](/blog/setup/express) to setup a project with javascript or typescript.

# Prisma Setup

First, you need to install Prisma globally.

```bash
npm install prisma
```

Then, you need to initialize Prisma in your project.

```bash
npx prisma init
```

This will create a `prisma` folder in your project. Inside the `prisma` folder, you will find a `schema.prisma` file. This is where you define your database schema.

# Database Connection

Overall you have two choices either you can use a SQL based database or a NoSQL based database.
[Here is the official doc](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started#choose-an-option-to-get-started-with-your-own-database) I'll show you how to work with MongoDB and Postgres, which are the two popular choices.

In the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, you can define your database connection.

The file looks like this 

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The **provider** is the type of database you are using. In this case, it is **"postgresql"**. You can change it to **"mongodb"** if you are using MongoDB.

The url comes from the environment variable. You can set the environment variable in a `.env` file.

```js
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
```

## Now define a model

You can define your model in the `schema.prisma` file. Here is an example of a user model.

```prisma
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  posts     Post[]
}
```

# Query database with Prisma Client

Prisma Client is a type-safe database client. It helps you to write queries in your language and it converts it to SQL queries.

Install the client

```bash
npm install @prisma/client
```

You will have to generate the client. You can do this by running the following command.

```bash
npx prisma generate
```
This will prepare the client for you. You can now use the client to query the database.

Now setup the client object as per the documentation. I like to do it inside `db/prisma-client.ts`

```ts caption="Remove types for js implementation"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient };

export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma || new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;

```

Now you can import the client and directly use it like this :

```js
import { prisma } from "./db/prisma-client";

const main = async () => {
  const user = await prisma.user.count();
  console.log("User count: ", user);
};

main();
```

# SQL vs NoSQL and Docker Images

There is a slight difference in the connection setup for SQL and NoSQL databases.

SQL or relational databases require a table structure and needs to be migrated before you can use it. You can use the following command to migrate the database.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This will create the tables in the database or update the existing table. **The step is not required for non relational databases like MongoDB.**

## MongoDB

If you don't have MongoDB installed, you can use the docker image. You can run the following command to start a MongoDB instance.

```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo
```

If you are using MongoDB, you can define the connection like this.

```prisma caption="test is the database name"
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL") || "mongodb://localhost:27017/test"
}
```


## Postgres

If you don't have Postgres installed, you can use the docker image. You can run the following command to start a Postgres instance.

```bash
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres
```

If you are using Postgres, you can define the connection like this.

```prisma caption="test is the database name"
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL") || "postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/test"
}
```

Prisma is a wonderful ORM and it is very easy to setup. You can use Prisma with many databases, it makes querying databases easier and is widely used. Enjoy using Prisma!
